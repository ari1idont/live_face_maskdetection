# live_face_maskdetection
This project was done in as a part of my internship at The Spark Foundation - Graduate Rotation Internship Program on July 2021. This github repo is for the complete code including from training to detection

##  The code is divided into 2 parts
- Training code
- detection code
## Training
A dataset of more than 1200 photos is used to train a CNN algorithm with tensorflow running in the backend. 
The trained model has an accuracy of over 95%. This model is also saved in a .h5 file.
## Detection
The trainned model is used for live detection done over the video feed with the help of opencv algorithm. The detection code draws a box and labels mask or no mask.
